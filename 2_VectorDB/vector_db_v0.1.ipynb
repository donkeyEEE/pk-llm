    "Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds like DDT, PCBs, and PFAS that resist environmental degradation, accumulate in the food chain, and persist in the environment (Sun et al., 2022). They are concerning due to their known toxic effects on humans, persistence in the environment, and harmful impacts on living organisms (Dean & Ma, 2007). POPs have been linked to various health issues, such as diabetes, weight change, and bioaccumulation in organisms like birds and fish (Rylander et al., 2015; ABAM model). Their ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain poses significant risks to ecosystems and human health."
