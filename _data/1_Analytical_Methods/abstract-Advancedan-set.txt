Raptors are ideal indicators for biomonitoring studies using wildlife in order 
to assess the environmental pollution in the terrestrial ecosystem, since they 
are placed in the highest trophic position in the food webs and their life 
expectancy is relatively long. In this study, 26 eggs of 4 bird species 
(Peregrine falcon, Eurasian curlew, Little owl and Eagle owl) collected in 
Germany, were investigated for the presence of persistent organic pollutants 
(POPs) and thousands of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). Generic sample 
preparation protocols were followed for the extraction of the analytes and the 
purification of the extracts, and the samples were analyzed both by liquid (LC) 
and gas chromatography (GC) coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), 
for capturing a wide range of organic micropollutants with different 
physicochemical properties. State-of-the-art screening methodologies were 
applied in the acquired HRMS data, including wide-scope target analysis of 2448 
known pollutants and suspect screening of over 65,000 environmentally relevant 
compounds. Overall, 58 pollutants from different chemical classes, such as plant 
protection products, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and medicinal products, 
as well as their transformation products, were determined through target 
analysis. Most of the detected compounds were lipophilic (logP>2), although the 
presence of (semi)polar contaminants should not be overlooked, underlying the 
need for holistic analytical approaches in environmental monitoring studies. 
p,p'-DDE, PCB 153 and PCB138, PFOS and methylparaben were the most frequently 
detected compounds. 50 additional substances were identified and semi-quantified 
through suspect screening workflows, including mainly compounds of industrial 
use with high production volume.

    Lancet Glob Health. 2022 Oct;10(10):e1361-e1362.

BACKGROUND: More than 3 billion people do not have access to clean energy and 
primarily use solid fuels to cook. Use of solid fuels generates household air 
pollution, which was associated with more than 2 million deaths in 2019. 
Although local patterns in cooking vary systematically, subnational trends in 
use of solid fuels have yet to be comprehensively analysed. We estimated the 
prevalence of solid-fuel use with high spatial resolution to explore subnational 
inequalities, assess local progress, and assess the effects on health in 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) without universal access to clean 
fuels.
METHODS: We did a geospatial modelling study to map the prevalence of solid-fuel 
use for cooking at a 5 km × 5 km resolution in 98 LMICs based on 2·1 million 
household observations of the primary cooking fuel used from 663 
population-based household surveys over the years 2000 to 2018. We use observed 
temporal patterns to forecast household air pollution in 2030 and to assess the 
probability of attaining the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target indicator 
for clean cooking. We aligned our estimates of household air pollution to 
geospatial estimates of ambient air pollution to establish the risk transition 
occurring in LMICs. Finally, we quantified the effect of residual primary 
solid-fuel use for cooking on child health by doing a counterfactual risk 
assessment to estimate the proportion of deaths from lower respiratory tract 
infections in children younger than 5 years that could be associated with 
household air pollution.
FINDINGS: Although primary reliance on solid-fuel use for cooking has declined 
globally, it remains widespread. 593 million people live in districts where the 
prevalence of solid-fuel use for cooking exceeds 95%. 66% of people in LMICs 
live in districts that are not on track to meet the SDG target for universal 
access to clean energy by 2030. Household air pollution continues to be a major 
contributor to particulate exposure in LMICs, and rising ambient air pollution 
is undermining potential gains from reductions in the prevalence of solid-fuel 
use for cooking in many countries. We estimated that, in 2018, 205 000 (95% 
uncertainty interval 147 000-257 000) children younger than 5 years died from 
lower respiratory tract infections that could be attributed to household air 
pollution.
INTERPRETATION: Efforts to accelerate the adoption of clean cooking fuels need 
to be substantially increased and recalibrated to account for subnational 
inequalities, because there are substantial opportunities to improve air quality 
and avert child mortality associated with household air pollution.

Due to their unique chemical properties, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 
(PFAS) have been used extensively as industrial surfactants and processing aids. 
While several types of PFAS have been voluntarily phased out by their 
manufacturers, these chemicals continue to be of ecological and public health 
concern due to their persistence in the environment and their presence in living 
organisms. Moreover, while the compounds referred to as "legacy" PFAS remain in 
the environment, alternative compounds have emerged as replacements for their 
legacy predecessors and are now detected in numerous matrices. In this review, 
we discuss the historical uses of PFAS, recent advances in analytical techniques 
for analysis of these compounds, and the fate of PFAS in the environment. In 
addition, we evaluate current biomonitoring studies of human exposure to legacy 
and emerging PFAS and examine the associations of PFAS exposure with human 
health impacts, including cancer- and non-cancer-related outcomes. Special focus 
is given to short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) and ether-substituted, 
polyfluoroalkyl alternatives including hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid 
(HFPO-DA; tradename GenX), 4,8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoic acid (DONA), and 6:2 
chlorinated polyfluoroethersulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA; tradename F-53B).

Microplastics have gradually become emerging environmental contaminants for 
their extensive distribution, small particle size, and harmful effects on 
organisms. Therefore, finding accurate, efficient, and rapid analytical methods 
for detecting microplastics pollution has become an urgent problem. We reviewed 
the derivation, transport, and classification of microplastics and then 
highlighted the harmfulness of microplastics which would bring microplastics 
pollution to the environment and potential damage to organisms. Further, various 
analytical methods were classified into the thermal analytical method, spectral 
analytical approach, and other analytical methods based on detection principles. 
In addition, the application of each analytical method in sea and soil was 
concluded in detail, and the promising development prospect of each analytical 
method was discussed. In the end, the chemical analytical method was proposed to 
explore further in the direction of no sample preparation, nondestructive 
analysis, low detection limit and it is crucial to establish a unified detection 
and identification method for microplastics in different environments.

This paper is an overview of screening methods recently developed for emerging 
halogenated contaminants and their transformation products. The target screening 
methods are available only for a limited number of emerging pollutants since the 
reference standards for these compounds are not always available, but a risk 
assessment of those micropollutants in environment must be performed anyhow. 
Therefore, the chromatographic techniques hyphenated with high resolution mass 
spectrometry (HRMS) trend to become indispensable methods for suspect and 
non-target screening of emerging halogenated contaminants. HRMS is also an 
effective tool for tentatively identification of the micropollutants' 
transformation products existing in much lower concentrations. To assess the 
transformation pathway of halogenated contaminants in environment, the 
non-target screening methods must be combined with biodegradation lab 
experiments and also with advanced oxidation and reduction processes that can 
mimic the transformation on these contaminants in environment. It is expected 
that in the future, the accurate-mass full-spectra of transformation products 
recorded by HRMS will be the basic information needed to elucidate the 
transformation pathways of emerging halogenated contaminants in aquatic 
environment.

Biomonitoring of both currently-used and banned-persistent pesticides is a very 
useful tool for assessing human exposure to these chemicals. In this review, we 
present current approaches and recent advances in the analytical methods for 
determining the biomarkers of exposure to pesticides in the most commonly used 
specimens, such as blood, urine, and breast milk, and in emerging non-invasive 
matrices such as hair and meconium. We critically discuss the main applications 
for sample treatment, and the instrumental techniques currently used to 
determine the most relevant pesticide biomarkers. We finally look at the future 
trends in this field.

Analysis and characterization of naturally occurring and engineered 
nanomaterials in the environment are critical for understanding their 
environmental behaviors and defining real exposure scenarios for environmental 
risk assessment. However, this is challenging primarily due to the low 
concentration, structural heterogeneity, and dynamic transformation of 
nanomaterials in complex environmental matrices. In this critical review, we 
first summarize sample pretreatment methods developed for separation and 
preconcentration of nanomaterials from environmental samples, including natural 
waters, wastewater, soils, sediments, and biological media. Then, we review the 
state-of-the-art microscopic, spectroscopic, mass spectrometric, 
electrochemical, and size-fractionation methods for determination of mass and 
number abundance, as well as the morphological, compositional, and structural 
properties of nanomaterials, with discussion on their advantages and 
limitations. Despite recent advances in detecting and characterizing 
nanomaterials in the environment, challenges remain to improve the analytical 
sensitivity and resolution and to expand the method applications. It is 
important to develop methods for simultaneous determination of multifaceted 
nanomaterial properties for in situ analysis and characterization of 
nanomaterials under dynamic environmental conditions and for detection of 
nanoscale contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., nanoplastics and biological 
nanoparticles), which will greatly facilitate the standardization of 
nanomaterial analysis and characterization methods for environmental samples.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are heterogenous in structure, chemical 
and physical properties, and their capacity to partition into various 
environmental matrixes. In many cases, these chemicals can disrupt the endocrine 
systems of vertebrate and invertebrate organisms when present at very low 
concentrations. Therefore, sensitive and varied analytical methods are required 
to detect these compounds in the environment. This review summarizes the 
analytical methods and instruments that are most used to monitor for EDCs in 
selected environmental matrixes. Only those matrixes for which there is a clear 
link between exposures and endocrine effects are included in this review. Also 
discussed are emerging methods for sample preparation and advanced analytical 
instruments that provide greater selectivity and sensitivity.

The development of robust bioanalytical devices and biosensors for infectious 
pathogens is progressing well with the advent of new materials, concepts, and 
technology. The progress is also stepping towards developing high throughput 
screening technologies that can quickly identify, differentiate, and determine 
the concentration of harmful pathogens, facilitating the decision-making process 
for their elimination and therapeutic interventions in large-scale operations. 
Recently, much effort has been focused on upgrading these analytical devices to 
an intelligent technological platform by integrating them with modern 
communication systems, such as the internet of things (IoT) and machine learning 
(ML), to expand their application horizon. This review outlines the recent 
development and applications of bioanalytical devices and biosensors to detect 
pathogenic microbes in environmental samples. First, the nature of the recent 
outbreaks of pathogenic microbes such as foodborne, waterborne, and airborne 
pathogens and microbial toxins are discussed to understand the severity of the 
problems. Next, the discussion focuses on the detection systems chronologically, 
starting with the conventional methods, advanced techniques, and emerging 
technologies, such as biosensors and other portable devices and detection 
platforms for pathogens. Finally, the progress on multiplex assays, wearable 
devices, and integration of smartphone technologies to facilitate pathogen 
detection systems for wider applications are highlighted.

Microplastics and nanoplastics have become emerging particulate anthropogenic 
pollutants and rapidly turned into a field of growing scientific and public 
interest. These tiny plastic particles are found in the environment all around 
the globe as well as in drinking water and food, raising concerns about their 
impacts on the environment and human health. To adequately address these issues, 
reliable information on the ambient concentrations of microplastics and 
nanoplastics is needed. However, micro- and nanoplastic particles are extremely 
complex and diverse in terms of their size, shape, density, polymer type, 
surface properties, etc. While the particle concentrations in different media 
can vary by up to 10 orders of magnitude, analysis of such complex samples may 
resemble searching for a needle in a haystack. This highlights the critical 
importance of appropriate methods for the chemical identification, 
quantification, and characterization of microplastics and nanoplastics. The 
present article reviews advanced methods for the representative mass-based and 
particle-based analysis of microplastics, with a focus on the sensitivity and 
lower-size limit for detection. The advantages and limitations of the methods, 
and their complementarity for the comprehensive characterization of 
microplastics are discussed. A special attention is paid to the approaches for 
reliable analysis of nanoplastics. Finally, an outlook for establishing 
harmonized and standardized methods to analyze these challenging contaminants is 
presented, and perspectives within and beyond this research field are discussed.
