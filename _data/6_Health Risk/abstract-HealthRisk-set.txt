BACKGROUND: Findings and limitations of previous studies on persistent organic 
pollutants (POPs) and pancreatic cancer risk support conducting further research 
in prospective cohorts.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the 
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. 
Participants were 513 pancreatic cancer cases and 1020 matched controls. 
Concentrations of 22 POPs were measured in plasma collected at baseline.
RESULTS: Some associations were observed at higher concentrations of p, p'-DDT, 
trans-nonachlor, β-hexachlorocyclohexane and the sum of six organochlorine 
pesticides and of 16 POPs. The odds ratio (OR) for the upper quartile of 
trans-nonachlor was 1.55 (95% confidence interval 1.06-2.26; P for 
trend = 0.025). Associations were stronger in the groups predefined as most 
valid (participants having fasted >6 h, with microscopic diagnostic 
confirmation, normal weight, and never smokers), and as most relevant (follow-up 
≥10 years). Among participants having fasted >6 h, the ORs were relevant for 10 
of 11 exposures. Higher ORs were also observed among cases with microscopic 
confirmation than in cases with a clinical diagnosis, and among normal-weight 
participants than in the rest of participants. Among participants with a 
follow-up ≥10 years, estimates were higher than in participants with a shorter 
follow-up (for trans-nonachlor: OR = 2.14, 1.01 to 4.53, P for trend = 0.035). 
Overall, trans-nonachlor, three PCBs and the two sums of POPs were the exposures 
most clearly associated with pancreatic cancer risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Individually or in combination, most of the 22 POPs analysed did 
not or only moderately increased the risk of pancreatic cancer.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review was to summarise current evidence 
that some environmental chemicals may be able to interfere in the endocrine 
regulation of energy metabolism and adipose tissue structure.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent findings demonstrate that such endocrine-disrupting 
chemicals, termed "obesogens", can promote adipogenesis and cause weight gain. 
This includes compounds to which the human population is exposed in daily life 
through their use in pesticides/herbicides, industrial and household products, 
plastics, detergents, flame retardants and as ingredients in personal care 
products. Animal models and epidemiological studies have shown that an 
especially sensitive time for exposure is in utero or the neonatal period. In 
summarising the actions of obesogens, it is noteworthy that as their structures 
are mainly lipophilic, their ability to increase fat deposition has the added 
consequence of increasing the capacity for their own retention. This has the 
potential for a vicious spiral not only of increasing obesity but also 
increasing the retention of other lipophilic pollutant chemicals with an even 
broader range of adverse actions. This might offer an explanation as to why 
obesity is an underlying risk factor for so many diseases including cancer.

Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published in PubMed, 
Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, we identified nine articles that provide 
evidence of the relationship between persistent organic pollutants and 
hyperuricemia. Our researchers assess the quality of the included studies and 
their risk of bias using the recommended method and tool. This study uses 
meta-analyses of the random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate 
combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the 
risk of hyperuricemia was strongly associated with three perfluorinated 
compounds, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS, with the OR(95%CI) of 1.26 (1.07-1.47), 
1.44(1.15-1.79), and 1.23(1.01-1.50) respectively. We also found a weak 
association between two other perfluorinated compounds, PFDA and PFHxS. Other 
than that, the summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident hyperuricemia were 2.34 
(1.79-3.08) for DDT, 3.25(2.40-4.39) for DDE, 2.57 (1.37-4.81) for PCBs and 
3.05(2.22-4.19) in trans-nonanchlor. Therefore, DDT and its breakdown product, 
DDE, PCBs, and trans-nonanchlor have also been linked with an increased risk of 
hyperuricemia in humans. This study finds that persistent organic pollutant is a 
critical factor for hyperuricemia, and further studies in specific regions will 
be considered in the future.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic chemicals that can persist in 
the environment for a longer period due to their non-biodegradability. The 
pervasive and bio-accumulative behavior of POPs makes them highly toxic to the 
environmental species including plants, animals, and humans. The present review 
specifies the POP along with their fate, persistence, occurrence, and risk 
analysis towards humans. The different biological POPs degradation methods, 
especially the microbial degradation using bacteria, fungi, algae, and 
actinomycetes, and their mechanisms were described. Moreover, the source, 
transport of POPs to the environmental sources, and the toxic nature of POPs 
were discussed in detail. Agricultural and industrial activities are 
distinguished as the primary source of these toxic compounds, which are 
delivered to air, soil, and water, affecting on the social and economic 
advancement of society at a worldwide scale. This review also demonstrated the 
microbial degradation of POPs and outlines the potential for an 
eco-accommodating and cost-effective approach for the biological remediation of 
POPs using microbes. The direction for future research in eliminating POPs from 
the environmental sources through various microbial processes was emphasized.

This review aims to provide an overview of the sources and reactions of 
persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and surfactants in soil and sediments, the 
surfactant-enhanced solubilisation of POPs, and the unintended consequences of 
surfactant-induced remediation of soil and sediments contaminated with POPs. 
POPs include chemical compounds that are recalcitrant to natural degradation 
through photolytic, chemical, and biological processes in the environment. POPs 
are potentially toxic compounds mainly used in pesticides, solvents, 
pharmaceuticals, or industrial applications and pose a significant and 
persistent risk to the ecosystem and human health. Surfactants can serve as 
detergents, wetting and foaming compounds, emulsifiers, or dispersants, and have 
been used extensively to promote the solubilization of POPs and their subsequent 
removal from environmental matrices, including solid wastes, soil, and 
sediments. However, improper use of surfactants for remediation of POPs may lead 
to unintended consequences that include toxicity of surfactants to soil 
microorganisms and plants, and leaching of POPs, thereby resulting in 
groundwater contamination.

We reviewed published manuscripts from toxicology and epidemiology reporting 
harmful health effects and doses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), 
published between 2000 and 2021. We found 42 in vitro, 32 in vivo, and 74 
epidemiological studies and abstracted the dose associated with harm in a common 
Molar unit. We hypothesized that the dose associated with harm would vary 
between animal and human studies. To test this hypothesis, for each of several 
POPs, we assessed the significance of variation in the dose associated with a 
harmful effect [categorized as non-thyroid endocrine (NTE), developmental 
neurotoxicity (DNT), and Thyroid] with study type (in vitro, in vivo, and 
Epidemiology) using a linear model after adjustment for basis (lipid weight, wet 
weight). We created a Calculated Safety Factor (CSF) defined as the toxicology 
dose divided by epidemiology dose needed to exhibit significant harm. 
Significant differences were found between study types ranging from <1 to 5.0 
orders of magnitude in the dose associated with harm. Our CSFs in lipid weight 
varied from 12.4 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.3, 47) for NTE effects in 
Epidemiology relative to in vivo studies to 6,244 (95% CI 2510, 15530) for DNT 
effects in Epidemiology relative to in vitro in wet weight representing 12.4 to 
6.2 thousand-fold more sensitivity in people relative to animals, and 
mechanistic models, respectively. In lipid weight, all CSF 95% CI lower bounds 
across effect categories were less than 6.5. CIs for CSFs ranged from less than 
one to four orders of magnitude for in vivo, and two to five orders of magnitude 
for in vitro vs. Epidemiology. A global CSF for all Epidemiology vs. all 
Toxicology was 104.6 (95% CI 72 to 152), significant at p<0.001.

Preventing adverse health effects of environmental chemical exposure is 
fundamental to protecting individual and public health. When done efficiently 
and properly, chemical risk assessment enables risk management actions that 
minimize the incidence and effects of environmentally induced diseases related 
to chemical exposure. However, traditional chemical risk assessment is faced 
with multiple challenges with respect to predicting and preventing disease in 
human populations, and epidemiological studies increasingly report observations 
of adverse health effects at exposure levels predicted from animal studies to be 
safe for humans. This discordance reinforces concerns about the adequacy of 
contemporary risk assessment practices for protecting public health. It is 
becoming clear that to protect public health more effectively, future risk 
assessments will need to use the full range of available data, draw on 
innovative methods to integrate diverse data streams, and consider health 
endpoints that also reflect the range of subtle effects and morbidities observed 
in human populations. Considering these factors, there is a need to reframe 
chemical risk assessment to be more clearly aligned with the public health goal 
of minimizing environmental exposures associated with disease.

Addressing uncertainties in human health risk assessment is a critical issue 
when evaluating the effects of contaminants on public health. A range of 
uncertainties exist through the source-to-outcome continuum, including exposure 
assessment, hazard and risk characterisation. While various strategies have been 
applied to characterising uncertainty, classical approaches largely rely on how 
to maximise the available resources. Expert judgement, defaults and tools for 
characterising quantitative uncertainty attempt to fill the gap between data and 
regulation requirements. The experiences of researching 
2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) illustrated uncertainty sources and 
how to maximise available information to determine uncertainties, and thereby 
provide an 'adequate' protection to contaminant exposure. As regulatory 
requirements and recurring issues increase, the assessment of complex scenarios 
involving a large number of chemicals requires more sophisticated tools. Recent 
advances in exposure and toxicology science provide a large data set for 
environmental contaminants and public health. In particular, biomonitoring 
information, in vitro data streams and computational toxicology are the crucial 
factors in the NexGen risk assessment, as well as uncertainties minimisation. 
Although in this review we cannot yet predict how the exposure science and 
modern toxicology will develop in the long-term, current techniques from 
emerging science can be integrated to improve decision-making.

In recent years, the phenomenon of abnormal pubertal timing in children has 
become increasingly common worldwide. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may 
be one of the risk factors contributing to this phenomenon, but the relationship 
between them is unclear based on current evidence. The purpose of this study was 
to determine the association of POPs exposure with pubertal timing in girls and 
boys by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and 
Embase databases for studies before June 1, 2023. Meta-analysis was performed by 
pooling relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) or prevalence ratio (PR) or hazard 
ratio (HR) estimates with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis, 
publication bias assessment and sensitivity analysis were also carried out. A 
total of 21 studies were included, involving 2479 boys and 8718 girls. The 
results of meta-analysis showed that exposure to POPs was significantly 
associated with delayed pubertal timing in girls (RR: 0.85; 95 % CI: 0.79-0.91; 
p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant association between exposure 
to POPs and pubertal timing in boys (RR: 1.18; 95 % CI: 0.99-1.40; p = 0.070). 
Subgroup analysis showed that there may be gender differences in the effects of 
exposure to POPs on pubertal timing. Our results suggested that exposure to POPs 
could delay pubertal timing in girls. However, based on current evidence, no 
significant association was found between POPs exposure and pubertal timing in 
boys.

With an increasing need to incorporate new approach methodologies (NAMs) in 
chemical risk assessment and the concomitant need to phase out animal testing, 
the interpretation of in vitro assay readouts for quantitative hazard 
characterisation becomes more important. Physiologically based kinetic (PBK) 
models, which simulate the fate of chemicals in tissues of the body, play an 
essential role in extrapolating in vitro effect concentrations to in vivo 
bioequivalent exposures. As PBK-based testing approaches evolve, it will become 
essential to standardise PBK modelling approaches towards a consensus approach 
that can be used in quantitative in vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE) 
studies for regulatory chemical risk assessment based on in vitro assays. Based 
on results of an ECETOC expert workshop, steps are recommended that can improve 
regulatory adoption: (1) define context and implementation, taking into 
consideration model complexity for building fit-for-purpose PBK models, (2) 
harmonise physiological input parameters and their distribution and define 
criteria for quality chemical-specific parameters, especially in the absence of 
in vivo data, (3) apply Good Modelling Practices (GMP) to achieve transparency 
and design a stepwise approach for PBK model development for risk assessors, (4) 
evaluate model predictions using alternatives to in vivo PK data including 
read-across approaches, (5) use case studies to facilitate discussions between 
modellers and regulators of chemical risk assessment. Proof-of-concepts of 
generic PBK modelling approaches are published in the scientific literature at 
an increasing rate. Working on the previously proposed steps is, therefore, 
needed to gain confidence in PBK modelling approaches for regulatory use.
