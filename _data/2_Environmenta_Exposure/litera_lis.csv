Awareness of the human health impacts of exposure to air pollution is growing 
rapidly. For example, it has become evident that the adverse health effects of 
air pollution are more pronounced in disadvantaged populations. Policymakers in 
many jurisdictions have responded to this evidence by enacting initiatives that 
lead to lower concentrations of air pollutants, such as urban traffic 
restrictions. In this review, we focus on the interplay between advances in 
environmental exposure assessment and developments in policy. We highlight 
recent progress in the granular measurement of air pollutants and 
individual-level exposures, and how this has enabled focused local policy 
actions. Finally, we detail an illustrative study designed to link 
individual-level health-relevant exposures with economic, behavioral, 
biological, familial, and environmental variables.",1

Targeting Environmental Neuro-Development Risks (Project TENDR), an alliance of leading scientists, health professionals, and advocates, is working to protect children from these toxic chemicals and pollutants, especially the disproportionate exposures experienced by children from families with low incomes and families of color.

Objective:This scoping review was initiated to map existing literature on disparities in neurodevelopmental outcomes for U.S. children from population groups who have been historically economically/socially marginalized and exposed to seven exemplar neurotoxicants: combustion-related air pollution (AP), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), organophosphate pesticides (OPs), phthalates (Phth), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

Methods:Systematic literature searches for the seven exemplar chemicals, informed by the Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome (PECO) framework, were conducted through 18 November 2022, using PubMed, CINAHL Plus (EBSCO), GreenFILE (EBSCO), and Web of Science sources. We examined these studies regarding authors' conceptualization and operationalization of race, ethnicity, and other indicators of sociodemographic and socioeconomic disadvantage; whether studies presented data on exposure and outcome disparities and the patterns of those disparities; and the evidence of effect modification by or interaction with race and ethnicity.

Results:Two hundred twelve individual studies met the search criteria and were reviewed, resulting in 218 studies or investigations being included in this review. AP and Pb were the most commonly studied exposures. The most frequently identified neurodevelopmental outcomes were cognitive and behavioral/psychological. Approximately a third (74 studies) reported investigations of interactions or effect modification with 69% (51 of 74 studies) reporting the presence of interactions or effect modification. However, less than half of the studies presented data on disparities in the outcome or the exposure, and fewer conducted formal tests of heterogeneity. Ninety-two percent of the 165 articles that examined race and ethnicity did not provide an explanation of their constructs for these variables, creating an incomplete picture.

Discussion:As a whole, the studies we reviewed indicated a complex story about how racial and ethnic minority and low-income children may be disproportionately harmed by exposures to neurotoxicants, and this has implications for targeting interventions, policy change, and other necessary investments to eliminate these health disparities. We provide recommendations on improving environmental epidemiological studies on environmental health disparities. To achieve environmental justice and health equity, we recommend concomitant strategies to eradicate both neurotoxic chemical exposures and systems that perpetuate social inequities. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11750.",1

children's development is an important area of inquiry in order to better 
understand contextual factors that shape development and ultimately school 
readiness among young children. There is evidence suggesting negative links 
between exposure to environmental toxicants and negative physical health 
outcomes (i.e. asthma, allergies) in children. However, research on children's 
exposure to environmental toxicants and other developmental outcomes (cognitive, 
socioemotional) is limited. Objectives The goal of the current review was to 
assess the existing literature on the links between environmental toxicants 
(excluding heavy metals) and children's cognitive, socioemotional, and 
behavioral development among young children. Methods This literature review 
highlights research on environmental toxicants (i.e. pesticide exposure, 
bisphenol A, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco smoke, polychlorinated 
biphenyls, flame retardants, phthalates and gas pollutions) and children's 
development across multiple domains. Results The results highlight the potential 
risk of exposure to multiple environmental toxicants for young children's 
cognitive and socioemotional development. Discussion Discussion will focus on 
the role of environmental toxicants in the cognitive and socioemotional 
development of young children, while highlighting gaps in the existing 
literature.",1

to contribute to economic growth and societal well-being across industrial 
sectors. Sustainable nanotechnology requires a scientifically based and 
proportionate risk governance structure to support innovation, including a 
robust framework for environmental risk assessment (ERA) that ideally builds on 
methods established for conventional chemicals to ensure alignment and avoid 
duplication. Exposure assessment developed as a tiered approach is equally 
beneficial to nano-specific ERA as for other classes of chemicals. Here we 
present the developing knowledge, practical considerations and key principles 
need to support exposure assessment for engineered nanomaterials for regulatory 
and research applications.",1

RNA (circRNA) expression through multiple exposure routes; yet, the underlying 
molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), especially 
circRNAs, play important roles in epigenetic regulation and disease 
pathogenesis; however, few studies have examined the function of circRNAs in 
chemical contamination-induced diseases. CircRNAs are covalently closed 
continuous loops that do not possess 5' and 3' ends, increasing their structural 
stability and limiting degradation by exoribonucleases. In addition, 
environmental chemical exposure-related diseases are often accompanied by 
aberrant expression of specific circRNAs and those circRNAs are often detected 
in tissues and body fluids. Based on these characteristics, circRNAs may serve 
as candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis of diseases related to environmental 
chemical exposure. Here, we review the generation and function of circRNAs, and 
the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of environmental 
chemical exposure-related disorders by circRNAs. This is the first comprehensive 
review of the relationship between environmental chemical exposure and circRNAs 
in chemical exposure-induced diseases.",1

in the agricultural, industrial, and health areas, but their toxicities in both 
humans and animals have always been a concern. Regardless of acute poisonings 
which are common for some classes of pesticides like organophosphoruses, the 
association of chronic and sub-lethal exposure to pesticides with a prevalence 
of some persistent diseases is going to be a phenomenon to which global 
attention has been attracted. In this review, incidence of various malignant, 
neurodegenerative, respiratory, reproductive, developmental, and metabolic 
diseases in relation to different routes of human exposure to pesticides such as 
occupational, environmental, residential, parental, maternal, and paternal has 
been systematically criticized in different categories of pesticide toxicities 
like carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, pulmonotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, 
developmental toxicity, and metabolic toxicity. A huge body of evidence exists 
on the possible role of pesticide exposures in the elevated incidence of human 
diseases such as cancers, Alzheimer, Parkinson, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
asthma, bronchitis, infertility, birth defects, attention deficit hyperactivity 
disorder, autism, diabetes, and obesity. Most of the disorders are induced by 
insecticides and herbicides most notably organophosphorus, organochlorines, 
phenoxyacetic acids, and triazine compounds.

comprised of two or more fused benzene rings arranged in various configurations. 
PAHs are widespread environmental contaminants formed as a result of incomplete 
combustion of organic materials such as fossil fuels. The occurrence of PAHs in 
ambient air is an increasing concern because of their carcinogenicity and 
mutagenicity. Although emissions and allowable concentrations of PAHs in air are 
now regulated, the health risk posed by PAH exposure suggests a continuing need 
for their control through air quality management. In light of the environmental 
significance of PAH exposure, this review offers an overview of PAH properties, 
fates, transformations, human exposure, and health effects (acute and chronic) 
associated with their emission to the atmosphere. Biomarkers of PAH exposure and 
their significance are also discussed.

their impact on the environment a matter of considerable concern. Due to China's 
recent economic development and population growth, it has become one of the 
largest manufacturers and consumers of PAEs, with an associated contamination 
threat to several environmental compartments. The aim of this overview is to 
present a systematic account of PAE occurrence in various environmental media in 
China in the last decade, including the air, surface water, sediments, soil, 
sewage, and sludge; human exposure to PAEs is also evaluated. This reveals a 
location-dependence that can be attributed to regional differences in economic 
and industrial development as well as specific geographic location. A need for 
further study into the transportation and transformation behavior of PAEs in 
different environmental media and into PAE control technologies is identified, 
as a means of effectively assessing potential ecological and health risks.",1

Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants in 2011. However, thorough 
reports on recent data regarding this topic are lacking. Moreover, potential 
associations between HCBD and some chlorinated organics have usually been 
ignored in previous research. In this review, possible formation pathways and 
sources, current environmental occurrences and human exposure risks of HCBD are 
discussed, as well as the association with several organochlorine compounds. The 
results reveal that unintentional production and emission from industrial 
activities and waste treatments are the main sources of HCBD. Similar precursors 
are found for HCBD and chlorobenzenes, indicating the presence of common 
sources. Although recent data indicates that levels of HCBD in the environment 
are generally low, risks from human exposure to HCBD, together with other 
pollutants, may be high. More attention in the future needs to be paid to the 
mixed contamination of HCBD and other pollutants from common sources.",1

on compounds that were only recently investigated. The importance of methods 
sensitivity and particularly the influence of this parameter on the results 
presented in previous publications is highlighted. This report also investigates 
the relevance of hair analysis as an indicator of subjects' level of exposure 
and underlines limitations that are still associated with this matrix. This 
study also presents a critical assessment of some specific aspects presented in 
the literature as well as future needs to strengthen the position of hair as a 
relevant biomarker of exposure to be used in epidemiological studies.
